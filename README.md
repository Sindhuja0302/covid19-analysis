# COVID-19 Deaths Analysis in Ireland

This project analyzes COVID-19 deaths in Ireland by **age group** and **week**, using official data. The goal is to understand how different age groups were affected over time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Why this project?

During the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding how the virus impacted different age groups was important for public health policies, healthcare resources, and risk communication.  
This project helps us explore questions like:
- How did COVID-19 deaths vary across age groups?
- Were older adults more vulnerable compared to younger ones?
- How did the number of deaths change week by week?

By analyzing this data, we can visualize trends and gain insights into the **impact of COVID-19 on different sections of the population**.

## What’s in this project?

-  Cleaned and transformed the data
-  Created summary tables by age and week
-  Visualized the data using:
 - Bar chart of total deaths by age group
 - Line chart of weekly deaths
 - Multi-line chart showing deaths by week for each age group
